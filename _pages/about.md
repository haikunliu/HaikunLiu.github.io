Bio
------
I am a Professor at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), China. I obtained my Ph.D. in Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2014, under [Dr.Hai Jin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=o02W0aEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). From January 2013 to January 2015, I was a Research Fellow at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), working with [Dr.Bingsheng He](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~hebs/). My research interests include In-memory computing, new non-volatile memory technologies, computing system virtualization/cloud computing, etc. My papers have been published in major conferences and journals, including ASPLOS, ISCA, HPCA, DAC, SC, ICS, HPDC. I have served as a Chair of the PC area for international conferences in IEEE Big Data Congress, ICA3PP, ICPADS and a PC member for SC, ICDCS, Cluster, CCGrid, etc. I am the senior member of [CCF](https://www.ccf.org.cn/), member of [ACM](https://www.acm.org/) and [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/), member of CCF High Performance Computing Committee and member of CCF Architecture Committee.
