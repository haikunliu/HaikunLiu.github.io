Bio
------
I am a Professor at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), China. I obtained my Ph.D. in Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2012, under the supervision of  [Prof.Hai Jin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=o02W0aEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). From January 2013 to January 2015, I was a Research Fellow at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), working with [Dr.Bingsheng He](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~hebs/). My research interests include in-memory computing, non-volatile memory technologies, virtualization/cloud computing, etc. I have co-authered more than 60 papers published in most prestigious conferences and journals, such as ASPLOS, ISCA, HPCA, DAC, SC, ICS, HPDC. I have served as TPC vice co-chairs in international conferences such as IEEE Big Data Congress, ICA3PP, ICPADS, and served as a PC member for SC, ICDCS, Cluster, CCGrid, etc.
